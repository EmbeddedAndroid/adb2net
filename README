# adb2net

This is the least complicated way I've found to found to forward a remotely
connected adb target. You don't have to mess about with restarting the
adb server, because you are forwarding the target's adb traffic directly
over a tcp socket from the remote host.

## Installation

1) Remote host with password less authentication setup
2) Target device connected to the remote host
3) Target device's adb serial number

## Usage

./adb2net <user@remoteserver> <adbserial> [local port]

## Untested

1) More than one device on the same remote host
