# adb2net

This is the least complicated way I've found to forward a remotely
connected adb target. You don't have to mess about with restarting the
adb server, because you are forwarding the target's adb traffic directly
over a tcp socket from the remote host.

## Installation

1) Remote host with password less authentication setup
2) Target device connected to the remote host
3) Target device's adb serial number

## Usage

Connect to remote target over adb:

./adb2net -h <user@remoteserver> -s <adbserial>

Connect to remote target over adb with debugging:

./adb2net -h <user@remoteserver> -s <adbserial> --debug

Connect to remote target over adb with a user specified local port (Default is 5555):

./adb2net -h <user@remoteserver> -s <adbserial> -l 5558

Disconnect from remote target by specifying the local port in use:

./adb2net -k 5555

## Tested

1) Multple devices, with unique local ports
